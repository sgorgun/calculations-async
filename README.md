# Asynchronously Calculation

- Implement a `CalculateSum` method that calculate the sum from `1` to `n` synchronously.
- Implement a `CalculateSumAsync` method that calculate the sum from `1` to `n` asynchronously.
- Complete console application witch calculate asynchronously sum from `1` to `n`. The value of `n` is set by the user from the console. The user has the right to change the boundary `n` in the course of calculations, which should lead to a restart of the calculation, this should not crash the application. After receiving the result, be able to continue calculations without leaving the console.
